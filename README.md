# Timed Developer Quizzer

## Description
This simple test was created to help developers keep their fundamentals sharp and for aspiring developers a introduction into the world of coding. First, you are presented with four multiple choices answers and a randomised set of questions. Next, when the user selects an answer the program will prompt the user if the question is correct or not, and if correct, the app will proceed to the next question. If an incorrect answer is selected, the program will deduct 10 seconds from the current time. Then after the timer reaches zero or after all questions are answered, the user can add their initials and to a final score page. Finally, the program will go back to the home page and can attempt many more times!
